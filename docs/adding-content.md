The first thing you need to do after installing DomainMOD is add a Domain Registrar & Domain Registrar Account (in DomainMOD lingo, these are known as Assets). Assets are the building blocks of DomainMOD, and certain ones are required before you can start adding your Domains & SSL Certificates. For example, if you try to add a domain before adding a registrar account, DomainMOD will be unable to link the domain to its proper account, and you won't be able to add the domain.

Adding these Assets only takes a minute, and we've outlined the steps below so all you have to do is follow along and you'll be ready-to-go in no time!

Add a Domain Registrar
----------------------
1. Click on **Assets** on the main menu.

2. Click on **Domain Registrars** on the Assets list.

3. Click on the **Add Registrar** button.

4. Enter the Registrar's Name and then click the **Add Domain Registrar** button.

And that's all there is to it, you've just added your first Domain Registrar!

Now it's time to add your first Domain Registrar Account.

Add a Domain Registrar Account
------------------------------
1. Click on **Assets** on the main menu.

2. Click on **Domain Registrar Accounts** on the Assets list.

3. Click on the **Add Registrar Account** button.

4. Choose the Domain Registrar and Account Owner that this registrar account belongs to, enter your account Username, and then click the **Add Registrar Account** button.

**NOTE:** Unless you've already added some Account Owners in the Assets section, the default owner will be set to [no owner]. You can update the owner information in the Assets section by clicking on the Account Owners link.

Congratulations, you've finished adding your first Domain Registrar & Domain Registrar Account!

Now you're ready to start adding your domains to DomainMOD.

(*If you plan on using DomainMOD to manage your SSL Certificate, you will need to repeat these steps, but instead of a Domain Registrar & Domain Registrar Account, you will need to add an SSL Provider & SSL Provider Account.*)

2. Click on **SSL Providers** on the Assets list.

3. Click on the **Add SSL Provider** button.

Now it's time to add your first SSL Provider Account.
